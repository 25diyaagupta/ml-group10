2. Open the file [ml_group10_2.ipynb](ml_group10_2.ipynb) to see how to depict the earthquake ground motion patterns using machine learning tools.

3. To open the file type the following command in the terminal

    ```python
    jupyter notebook ml_group10_2.ipynb
    ```

4. To install the dependencies type the following command in the terminal

    ```python
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install sklearn
    pip install pandas
    pip install numpy
    pip install seaborn
    pip install statsmodels
    ```

5. Now when the file ml_group10_2.ipynb is opened, you can run each line one by one to see the outputs as follows
